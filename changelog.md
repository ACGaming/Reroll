# Initial 1.16.5 Release
Note that there might be some bugs or issues that need to be ironed out. There currently no built in mod support. I will be adding support for some must have mods like Curios soon.

# Changes
- New Dice model.
- New config options.
- New grave block.
- Massively improved codebase. 1.12.2 is a mess.
