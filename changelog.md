# Changes
- Added config options for rerolling on death, starting locked, cooldown timer for using the dice, sending your inventory into a chest, whether ender chest resets, etc.
- Added new Dice item that can be used to reroll.
- Modified initial inventory to include the dice.
- Set new defaults for config options.

# Fixes
- Fixed issue where useCurrentDim and overrideDim weren't working. They should be now (unless I broke something since then).
