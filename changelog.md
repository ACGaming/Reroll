# Changes
- Added new feature to require the dice to reroll.
- Added new Dice image.
- Adjusted reroll y position to potentially prevent players from being partially inside a block when they reroll.

# Fixes
- Fixed dice rerolling twice.
- Fixed being on fire after reroll if you were on fire (it's not perfect as lag will still make it possible).
- Fixed reroll on death incorrectly having 'true' set in code for testing.
