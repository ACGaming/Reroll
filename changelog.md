With any luck, this should fix the issues with using Reroll in Trepidation!

# Changes
- Add method to dice to allow right clicking on air or on a block.
- Add "max_tries" config option to prevent reroll from killing a server by loading too many chunks searching for a spawn location.
- Fix findClosest algorithm by inverting condition and removing unnecessary "continue" statement.
